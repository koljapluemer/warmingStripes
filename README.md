Recently, I fell in love with the data visualization [Warming Stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes).

Intrigued, I recreated my own version with [DWD](https://www.dwd.de/DE/Home/home_node.html) data relevant to the region I am currently living in: Bavaria, Germany.

The stripes were generated in Python (note to self: I should Open Source that) and the project was finalized as a poster in Adobe Illustrator.

This is a chaotic dump of all my code and files to make a (somewhat simplified) version of [Warming Stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes).

Check out [poster.pdf](/Poster.pdf) for the final result. Feel free to recycle this code - if there is actual interest, I might even clean this up at some point.
